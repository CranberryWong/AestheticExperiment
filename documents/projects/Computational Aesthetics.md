Aesthetics are influential in how willingly, how comfortably and how efficiently humans interact with objects, devices, idea, and systems. Although the HCI community strives to dig out knowledge, principles and guidelines of aesthetics for interface and interaction design, it still remains much room to seek an epistemological corpus which should include the notion, human factors and the quantification of aesthetic aspects. 

Conventional empirical studies lack the abilities which quantified the aesthetic perspective of design due to its subjectivity, thus the conclusions are hard and fuzzy to be applied to practical design. Computational aesthetics is expected to fill this gap from at least two levels. From the practical level, tools will be developed to help designers to address aesthetic design issues, and optimize the interface design accordingly. From the engaging level, researchers should aim at understanding the aesthetic perception of users, and help them to form or train aesthetic capabilities. We expect to understand the commonality among different modalities and thus seek a computational basis and evaluate aesthetics interaction. This work will also advance us towards the final goal of implementing an automatic design system with high design quality. It will be expected in the future research agenda if the views from the disciplines including philosophy, HCI, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics join and discuss the promising direction of computational aesthetics.
