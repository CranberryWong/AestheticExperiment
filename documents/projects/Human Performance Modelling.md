The development of human performance models has an important place in respect to both theory and practice in the field of human computer interaction. However, current studies focus on the effect of system factors (e.g, target width and amplitude between the targets) on movement time. This project has sought to establish models that can accurately include human physiological and psychological information (e.g., subjective factors) into mathematical functions. Such models will promote accuracy and will be applicable in human computer interaction input devices evaluation. We have studied systematically both linear models and nonlinear models through basic computer tasks such as pointing tasks and steering tasks. A number of new human performance models were established. Comparing the traditional models, these models include not only the system layers (i.e. target width and distance to the target) but also the subjective layers.
