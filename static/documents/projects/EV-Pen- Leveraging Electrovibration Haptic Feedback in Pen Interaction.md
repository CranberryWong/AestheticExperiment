This project presents an Electrovibration Pen (EV-Pen) which incorporates electrovibration into pen interactions. The EV-Pen not only exploits the advantages of conventional pen-based interactions but also provides a wide range of haptic feedback modes without any form of mechanical actuator. The EV-Pen simulates real pen-on-paper feeling, enhancing the user experience in drawing and handwriting, and providing feedback while interacting with virtual textures and GUI elements on touchscreens.
