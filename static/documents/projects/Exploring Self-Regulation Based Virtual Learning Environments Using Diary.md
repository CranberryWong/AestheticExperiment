Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) such as Coursera and edX have become increasingly popular. However, achieving self-regulated learning remains an ongoing challenge in current VLEs.  This paper explores the use of “a diary” to enhance student self-regulation while learning in VLE. We compare student progress in self-regulation between an experimental group and a control group which uses VLE. In addition, the experimental group’s self-regulation performance from before and after using the diary were compared. 200 diary entries and 10 discussion sessions were coded. The results provide initial evidence that self-regulation can be significantly enhanced through proper methodologies such as the diary. Our work provides a first step toward self-regulation based virtual learning environments by keeping a diary.
