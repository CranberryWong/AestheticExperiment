Pen and finger become the popular input modalities for interacting with digital devices. This project aims to understand, improve, and design next generation user interface in the domain of pen and touch interactions. The project includes an empirical comparison between finger and pen gestures; proposing new interaction technique on large displays; and the fundamental study of pen-based interactions.
