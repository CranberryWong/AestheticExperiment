This project seeks to enhance equal access of visually impaired people to the mainstream technologies. We focus on understanding users and developing interfaces which are effective and usable for our users. The studies include motion gesture interfaces for various applications (e.g., mobile interactions), wearable vibration feedback and designing menu systems for visually impaired users.
