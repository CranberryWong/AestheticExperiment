Games have become part of our daily lives. Games have also been increasingly influential in the area of education and health. This project seeks to (1) improve gaming experiences and interaction techniques and (2) to apply games for the purposes of education, health, and social causes through traditional methods (e.g., interviews and questionnaires), combining with more advanced methods such as physiological methods, behavioural analytics, machine learning and neuroimaging methods.
