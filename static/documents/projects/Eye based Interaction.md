Dwell-based eye pointing methods are getting increasingly popular. This project focuses on dwell-based eye typing methods for two purposes, (1) to achieve eye cursor stability and (2) to model eye pointing target acquisition.

Dwell-based eye pointing methods are getting increasingly popular. These methods often frustrated users due to the eye cursor’s instability that mainly results from eye jitter and the limited accuracy of eye tracking. On the other hand, still there exist lack in quantitative modelling for the dominant eye pointing tasks of gaze input. This project focuses on dwell-based eye typing methods for two purposes, (1)  to introduce several methods, such as force field and speed reduction for counteracting the jittery movements of the eyes so as to improve the stability of eye cursor and (2) to model eye pointing target acquisition  based on Fitts’ law.
