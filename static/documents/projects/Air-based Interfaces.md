Air have several properties that can be utilized for interaction, such as air flow and air pressure. This project aims to leverage these air properties to design and develop novel interaction device. Also to study and understand experience and interaction between human and air-based interaction devices.

Air have several properties that can be utilized for interaction, such as air flow and air pressure. This project aims to leverage these air properties to design and develop novel interaction device. Also to study and understand experience and interaction between human and air-based interaction devices. Air-based interaction device have capabilites to provide analog information and can be utilized as input device as well as haptic device simultaneously. Air flow property can be utilized to levitate and manipulate small-light weight object in mid-air and to generate soft air-based non-contact tactile feedback in mid-air.
