![VICON (12 cameras)](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/954/40440708320_61a0b29189.jpg)| VICON (12 cameras)|Vicon is the leading developer of motion capture products and services for the Life Science, Entertainment and Engineering industries. Motion capture (mocap) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. In motion capture sessions, movements of one or more actors are sampled many times per second. Whereas early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate 3D positions, often the purpose of motion capture is to record only the movements of the actor, not his or her visual appearance. This animation data is mapped to a 3D model so that the model performs the same actions as the actor.

![Emotiv EEG (EEG, Epoc+)](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/963/42201545392_b48b985d44_o.jpg)|Emotiv EEG (EEG, Epoc+)|Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp, although invasive electrodes are sometimes used in specific applications. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain In clinical contexts, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time, as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp. Diagnostic applications generally focus on the spectral content of EEG, that is, the type of neural oscillations (popularly called "brain waves") that can be observed in EEG signals.
