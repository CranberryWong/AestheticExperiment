*Monday, May 8, 2017 to Thursday, May 11, 2017*

Hi,
This is Kavous from Center for Human Engaged Computing (CHEC) at Kochi University of Technology Japan. I am 2nd year Ph.D. students in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) under the supervision of Prof. Xiangshi Ren. Last month I had a great experience by attending at ACM CHI conference on Human factors in computing systems (CHI2017). So in this blog, I will share my journey with you.
 
CHI is the most prestigious venue at the field of HCI. CHI submission system is blind review with only one rebuttal chance, and it is usually very competitive to publish (600 papers got accepted over 2400 submission – 25% acceptance rate). CHI2017 (https://chi2017.acm.org) was held in Denver, the United States on May 6-11. Over 2800 researchers from 53 countries attended CHI 2017, and this creates a unique opportunity to exchange thoughts, receive feedback, inspire new ideas, and find new friends or maybe collaborators.
 
Indeed, my journey started 4 months before CHI. I had a very tough challenge to get USA visa because of Trump executive orders (travel ban). However, I never felt hopeless, and I always had great support from CHI community (especially CHI chair, Sue Fussell), my supervisor (Xiangshi Ren), all my friends at CHEC, and my family. Thanks to them!
 
CHI2017 started with a great opening plenary by Neri Oxman (MIT Media Lab) on Material Ecology reminding me that how HCI become broad and it can cover different research fields. I really liked the slogan which introduced by CHI Technical Program Chair (M.C. Schraefel) where she asked all audience to repeat loudly “DON’T BE SHY! SAY HI! AT CHI!” Perhaps this is the true spirit of every conference where young researchers have to forget about being shy and try to discuss as much as they can to get benefitted from the conference.
 
CHI 2017 was excellent for CHEC members and also for myself. Our members had totally 7 papers including 2 Full Papers (1 awarded as best paper), 2 Notes, 1 Workshop, 1 Late-Breaking Work and 1 Panel. My full paper entitled “A Framework for Interactive Mindfulness Meditation Using Attention-Regulation Process” (Click to read the manuscript: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025914) (Click to look at preview video: https://youtu.be/gxYgXz4U-HE) presented by my co-author (Peng) and I at Mindfulness session. We had 20 minutes including 5 minutes Q&A. I felt a bit nervous at first because I have never talked before to such a large group of audience. Fortunately, everything went smooth. Besides my work, I listened to other great talks in the same session and had a chance to know other people who are working in the same field with me. Mindful technologies are a novel trend in HCI, which attracted a lot of attention at CHI 2017. Consequently, we were invited to a podcast interview by Kai Lukoff (Ph.D. student in Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle). It took 30 minutes and it was a quite new experience to talk on air. Later I will update the blog with the link to the podcast interview.
 
This year I also co-authored for a short paper called “Understanding the Role of Human Senses in Interactive Meditation” (Click to read the manuscript: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3026000&CFID=770272944&CFTOKEN=46566652) (Click to look at preview video: https://youtu.be/awR6qS5b_TI) which it was presented by another co-author Mahmoud.
 
I presented my poster entitled “Towards Cognitive Enhancement of the Elderly: A UX Study of a Multitasking Motion Video Game” (Click to read the manuscript: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3053105). Honestly, poster sessions were very valuable for me. Many audiences asked questions and I received useful feedbacks for my future study. I also found good friends when talking with authors besides my poster from Singapore and Germany. Last but not least, I attended a course about Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) by a research team from University of Bordeaux while I learned and discussed theory, practice, and ethics of BCI. In addition to research activities in the conference, I attended at different dinner activities with researchers from Japanese, Korean and Arab communities. I also found many Iranian young researchers working on HCI.
 
This blog introduces my last CHI experience. I hope I can always be wise, work hard and publish at flagship conferences and top tier journals to become a top researcher and contribute to the world.
 
End!
