We held a long distance walking to the Konan seaside on April 15th. The whole trip was over 23 kilometers and took around 8 hours. 16 members joined in this activity.​
 
It was lucky for us to get a sunny day after a whole night rain. The one-way hiking was relaxing and fortunately, we got the permission to visit a temple and the host was very kind with giving a real chanting. Also, as usual, philosophy topics were discussed during the activity. For lunch, we enjoyed the Unagi Don which is a feature of Japan. Finally, we reach the destination on the estuary of Nomobe river.
 
The back way seemed a little bit hard for moving. Thanked the "drivers" who took us a hot ramen after getting back. After one day’s walking, we were really tired, but it was also a good chance to conduct team building and promote understanding from each other, especially for the five new members from BNU. We look forward next hiking in 2019.​
