Even though it was raining, that didn't interfere people’s passion at all. Thanks to Prof Ren, Wang Zhenxin, and Kavous’s kindly help in driving members by car.A staff in the garden showed us how to pick a strawberry easily ( not just violently pull, firstly reverse the strawberry, then pull it gently), and told us some matters need attention.![Figure](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2823/34001737236_4ed39394a8_c.jpg)![Figure](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2885/34001737196_54dd97b77c_c.jpg)After a short tutorial and hand disinfection, we started our ”hunting” and competition for the “Big stomach King”. At the beginning, members got really confident to eat a lot of strawberry ( some of us even didn’t have their breakfast for this!), but after half of a hour, most of us have already surrender…Jimmy had like 80 strawberries, beat us all and won the competition without suspense.
