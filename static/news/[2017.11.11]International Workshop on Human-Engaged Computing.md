The Center for Human-Engaged Computing (CHEC) has organized an international workshop on Human-Engaged Computing (IWHEC 2017). The worship will be held at Kochi University of Technology in Japan on November 10th, 2017.

The aim of this workshop is to rethink the relationship between humans and computers with particular attention being paid to our future as human beings. Seven distinguished speakers from around the world and from several domains will give their different views on HEC and related topics. Consistent with HEC’s holistic approach, our speakers represent not only Human-Computer Interaction but also the humanities, engineering design, computer sciences and cognitive science.
