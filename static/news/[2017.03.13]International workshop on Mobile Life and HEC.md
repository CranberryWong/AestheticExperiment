He works in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design. He teaches HCI and related topics in IIT Bombay and in academic institutions all over India. He was one of the first teachers to introduce usability and ethnographic user studies methods in India. On Teacher's Day in 2016, he got an award for Excellence in Teaching from IIT Bombay. His researchs focused on user studies, interaction design, and usability evaluations for diverse domains including healthcare, literacy, Indian language text input, banking, education, industrial equipment, and FMCG packaging. His work has been for users in urban and rural India and on a variety of platforms including desktops, the web, mobile phones, ATMs, and custom hardware. He also worked in the area of integrating HCI activities with software engineering processes.**_Talk Title:_** Interaction design for emergent usersTalk Abstract: About twelve years ago, information and communication technologies (ICTs) were used by about 20% of the world population – a definite minority. The adoption of mobile telephony increased rapidly thereafter, and today ICTs in some form are in the hands of more than 80% of the world population, including the rural, the uneducated, and those in developing countries. Today their use of ICTs is limited, though there is potential waiting to be discovered, perhaps waiting to explode. We believe that the next set of "cool" opportunities are in designing for these "emergent" users. Innovations that were too distant to consider earlier are now realistically feasible. We believe we have opportunities to find solutions for problems that have plagued human beings for a long time. I will be sharing some interaction design projects in an attempt to illustrate these beliefs.My talk will focus on interaction design projects for the three major segments of Indian population: the non-English literate, the barely literate and the illiterate. For the non-English literate, I will discuss the issues related to text input in Indic languages. For the barely literate, I will share two small projects related to improving productivity. For the illiterate, I will share a healthcare project, and a project related to improving literacy skills.    **Zhiliang Wang**Professor, Department of Internet of Things and Electronic Engineering,  University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China**_Brief Bio:_** Wang Zhiliang, male, professor / Ph.D.,national second grade professor enjoying the special allowance of the State Council .
