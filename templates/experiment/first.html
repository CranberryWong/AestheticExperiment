            <p class="card-text">You're about to take a test on Lab in the Wild. Your contribution to our research allows us to learn more about
                cultural preferences around the world. The results from your test will also tell you something about yourself!
                Please read the following information carefully before proceeding.</p>

            <p class="card-text"> Why we are doing this research: We are trying to understand what makes a website look visually appealing. More
                specifically, the goal of this study is to find out what role our cultural background plays in shaping our
                visual preferences. What you will have to do: You will be shown screenshots of websites. You will then be
                asked to rate each one on a scale from 1 to 9 based on visual appeal. Your participation in this study is
                completely voluntary, and you may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss
                of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. What you will get out of it: We will give you feedback
                on how your results compare to those of other participants. The final results from this experiment will be
                posted on our blog page. The experiment is not designed to benefit you, but you may enjoy it and enjoy comparing
                your results with those of other participants. Privacy and Data Collection: We will not ask you for your
                name. Any data that we collect will be securely stored on our servers. Duration: Approximately 10 minutes.</p>
